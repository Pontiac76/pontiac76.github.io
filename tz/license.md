## A Note to Source Code Explorers

Congratulations! By examining this code, you've proven yourself to be among the elite 0.1% of users 
who actually look under the hood. While others merely click buttons, you've ventured into the realm 
where time itself is manipulated. Remember: any programmer can convert time zones, but it takes a 
special kind of curiosity to read someone else's implementation of it. Your debugger may never know 
your name, but your compiler salutes you.

P.S. If you found a bug, that was definitely intentional. It's not a mistakeâ€”it's an interactive
puzzle feature.
P.P.S. If you want to donate money for the use of this code, please donate your time or money to:
- Animal rescue, hospitals or adoption centers and services with food and/or money.
- Local charity Food Banks for the homelss
- Gifts of safe materials to be used by the mentally ill at your local hospitals
  ## Go to the hospital and ASK what is safe to donate.
