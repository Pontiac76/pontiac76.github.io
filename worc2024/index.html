# 2024 Event
## To Do before event
### In General
- [ ] Determine the hardware that's being given to each machine.  The 486 gets an LCD, but, the P3 gets the CRT (Because of resolution reasons).
- [ ] Which speaker goes to what machine?
- [ ] Keyboard/Mouse combinations
- [x] Obtain a couple PSUs, just in case these ones give out
- [ ] Obtain a decent UPS
- [ ] Get something to wheel the components around
- [ ] Make a backup of the CF cards and put them on the laptop.
- [ ] See if I have a USB based CF reader that I can dump images to
- [ ] Find a reasonable board for the monitor arm clamps to add stability


### 486 Stuff
- [ ] Get the menu application written
- [ ] Validate ICS type connections to allow the 486/P3 to work through cell phone (Laptop/Pi works as an access point between LAN and Cell)
- [ ] Get the server setup for mTel and validate ICS can work through it
- [ ] Document the life of the 486 including documenting drivers, cards installed, cards that "failed" and problems encountered and solved
- [ ] Put some games on the mTel server to "trial out" (To be demonstrated would be deleting the applications on the remote drive, remount, and show no damage done)
- [X] Doom1, 
- [X] doom2, 
- [ ] Warcraft 2
- [X] Install new psu
- [X] See if I can hide the cf card behind a fake face plate using magnets?

### P3-1Ghz
- [ ] Install some games for stand alone play, or, for network gaming (Need list of DOS based games that can run under 98 for this)
- [ ] Get a decent keyboard that isn't the G510.
- [ ] MAYBE come up with a more user friendly desktop app to handle what games should run?
- [X] StarCraft Brood Wars (last patch version that supported win98), 
- [X] quake 2, 
- [ ] Duke nukem 3d
- [X] unreal tournament GOTY edition.

### Sponsorship Display
- [X] Get the MiSTer running with Bens demo
- [ ] Potentially find something less expensive than the MiSTer - Ben might have a Maxi which makes my cost zero
